# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initial population of the Memory Bank based on analysis of the existing codebase (`package.json`, `nuxt.config.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, file structure).

## Recent Changes

- Created the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Populated these files with initial information inferred from the project's structure, dependencies, and configuration.

## Next Steps

- Complete this initial Memory Bank population task.
- Await further instructions from the user regarding the next development focus (e.g., frontend implementation, feature refinement, testing).

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Inferred project scope, features, and status based on code analysis, as direct requirements were not provided for this population task.
- Assumed API endpoint functionality largely matches the file structure in `server/api/`. Verification through testing or code review is needed.
- Noted the presence of Stripe dependency and payment-related fields in the `Booking` model, suggesting payment integration is a likely requirement.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Nuxt 3 Conventions:** Adherence to Nuxt's directory structure (`pages/`, `components/`, `layouts/`, `server/api/`).
- **Prisma:** Used as the ORM for MongoDB interaction, defining the data layer.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first approach for styling.
- **TypeScript:** Used throughout the project (Nuxt config, Prisma seed, API routes).
- **JWT Authentication:** Standard pattern for securing API endpoints.

## Learnings & Insights

- The project is a Nuxt 3 full-stack application aiming to be a teacher/student connection platform ("Academ Message").
- Core backend API functionality seems largely implemented.
- Frontend development (connecting UI to APIs) appears to be the main remaining work area.
- The project utilizes a modern stack (Nuxt 3, Prisma, MongoDB, Tailwind).
- PWA features are configured.
