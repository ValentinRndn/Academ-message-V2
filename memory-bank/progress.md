# Progress Tracker

## Current Status

- Core backend API endpoints for major features (auth, teachers, subjects, availability, bookings, messages, reviews) appear to be implemented based on the `server/api` structure.
- Frontend pages exist for core areas (`login`, `register`, `profile`, `messages`, `teachers`, `admin/teachers`).
- Prisma schema is defined, and database seeding scripts exist.
- Nuxt 3 project structure is established with Tailwind CSS and PWA support.

## What Works

*(Based on API structure, likely functional at the backend level):*
- User Registration & Login
- Fetching Teacher & Subject Lists
- Fetching Teacher Details & Availability
- Creating/Fetching Bookings
- Sending/Fetching Messages
- Submitting Reviews
- Admin Teacher Management (basic endpoint exists)

*(Frontend pages exist, but functionality needs verification):*
- Basic routing between pages.
- Display of some data (needs confirmation).

## What's Left to Build

- **Frontend Implementation:** Connect existing pages (`index.vue`, `login.vue`, `register.vue`, `profile.vue`, `messages.vue`, `teachers/[id].vue`, `teachers/index.vue`, `admin/teachers/index.vue`) fully to the backend APIs. Implement UI logic for booking, messaging, reviews, availability management (e.g., `components/TeacherAvailability.vue`).
- **Stripe Integration:** Implement payment processing logic on the frontend and backend if required.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling on both frontend and backend.
- **Testing:** Implementation of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Refinement:** UI/UX polishing, validation improvements.
- **Documentation:** Fill out remaining Memory Bank details, add code comments where needed.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*(To be determined - requires testing and code review.)*

## Evolution of Decisions
