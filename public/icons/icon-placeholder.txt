PWA Icon Placeholders

For a production application, you would need to replace these placeholder files with actual PNG images of the following sizes:

1. icon-64x64.png (64x64 pixels)
2. icon-144x144.png (144x144 pixels)
3. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
4. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons should be created using a graphic design tool like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or a free alternative like GIMP or Inkscape.

The icons should:
- Be square
- Have a consistent design across all sizes
- Use the primary color (#4F46E5) as the main color
- Include the app's logo or a simple "AM" text (for Academ Message)
- Have transparent backgrounds if possible

For development purposes, you can use online tools to generate PWA icons from a single source image.
